In this code, I ask for the radius of the circle and the number of points, which is a double. the seed is set to 0 and i call the random number from the hint to 2 different variables, one for the x value and one for the y value. i then set my variable s (side) to 2 * r.this is used to find the random x and y coordinate. then I use the distance formula to find d to the power of 2 from the left and right centers of the half circles. From the right side, the center is 2r away on the x and r away on the y axis. Then i have my if statement to compare if the distance from either the left or right is less than the radius squared, because if it is then it will be within the circle. If it is inside a circle, then 1 is added to counter IN. This is repeated for the number of points and at the end, pi is found by 4 * IN / number of points. I also cast variable IN as a temporary double, so that the computation will give a double value when doing division.
