For this project, I have my code ask the user to input there total balance, if they would like to bet on even or odd (or quit entirely, which breaks out of the while loop and displays their total amount), and what amount they want to bet. Then I generate a random number between 0 and 37 (because it doesn't include 37 it will go up to 36). I then mod that random number by 2 to determine if the number is even or odd and then compare that with the user's choice. If they match, then I add their bet amount to their total, if not I subtract it. The code runs in a loop until the user enters 0 to quit or their balance becomes  0.
